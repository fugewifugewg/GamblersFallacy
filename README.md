Gambler's Fallacy is a mod meant to provide dynamic, interesting Jokers without them being too unbalanced. I took a lot of game design inspiration from FTL's "Chain Vulcan". This mod has like 5 "Chain Vulcans" lmao



    FEATURING:

    Joker:  "Overkill" Doubles Blind and payout every ante! can you keep up?

    Joker:  "Gambler's Particle Accellerator": Any sucessfull roll makes it more unlikely to fail,
            but never impossible! how high can you build the improbability drive?

    Joker:  "Clown Car": Get in.

    Joker:  "Plasma: The Joker": Needs no introduction. You know her, you love her!

    Joker:  "Echo" retrigger jokers based on how many times the hand has been played in a round.
            it get's crazy once when you get a chain started! vulcan.

    Enhancement:  "Adaptive Card": Rerolls suit and rank on discard. Comes off easy

Mo' Sodas is a a mod that adds 30 Colas, one Soda for every Skip Tag, +more!

Inspired by 2012 era Minecraft mods akin to "Elemental Creepers" "All The TNT" "Mo' Creepers".

Any mod that add a bajillion creepers of every variety, you know the ones

Now YOU can experience the 2012 minecraft modding scene... IN BALATRO!

The Sodas are balanced so they do not invade the shop pool too much



    FEATURING:

    Joker:  "Six-Pack": Sell to fill your joker slot with Sodas!

    Joker:  "Big Cola": A family-size cola! For you.

    Joker:  "Unlabeled Beverage": I don't actually know what this one does...

    Joker:  "Soda Maker": Make Your Own Soda Scrub

    Joker:  "Drink Five Hour Energy Drink Five Hour Energy Drink Five hou":
            It's not a drink, it's more like a drink
