currently known bugs / jank:
    the Six pack currently does not fill its OWN joker slot with a random soda when sold. this bug is circumvented by always making the Six-Pack appear negative. need a better solution
    "+1 free" has artifacts of an earlier iteration of the joker. it does not need to be rare and in the shop pool in its current state.

Graphics:
    The clown car is a placeholder. it needs to look like a tiny clown car bulging full of jimbos
    the investor and overkill use the same graphic
